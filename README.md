### Hey ðŸ‘‹

I am a software engineer with > 9 years of experience in web development. Most of my work has been in enterprise solutions, and between full-time job, consulting and freelancing, I haven't been able to work on open source or public projects. Hence this very empty github profile.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working with Java (Spring Boot) and Typescript (Next.js)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python and Data Science
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [gabrielima.com](https://gabrielima.com)
